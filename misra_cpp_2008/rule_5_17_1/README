This rule is related to binary operators and assignment operator.

We consider the following cases

- `*` and `=`, vs. `*=`
- `/` and `=`, vs. `/=`
- `%` and `=`, vs. `%=`
- `+` and `=`, vs. `+=`
- `-` and `=`, vs. `-=`
- `<<` and `=`, vs. `<<=`
- `>>` and `=`, vs. `>>=`
- `&` and `=`, vs. `&=`
- `|` and `=`, vs. `|=`
- `^` and `=`, vs. `^=`

For example, if `a3 = a1 + a2; a1 += a2;` then `a1 == a3`, `a1 <= a3`, `a1 >= a3` should be true, and `a1 != a3` should be false.

An important question is where should we report the error.
Currently I suggest to report the error at where the class is declared.
This is not good becuase the implementation of overloaded operators could be in different files from where the class is declared.
