MISRA C++ 2008 Rule 15-4-1
If a function is declared with an exception-specification, then all declarations
of the same function (in other translation units) shall be declared with the same
set of type-ids.

Clang document says canonical types are useful for type comparisons (they allow
by-pointer equality tests) and useful for reasoning about whether something has a
particular form (e.g. is a function type), because they implicitly, recursively,
strip all typedefs out of a type.
See https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Type.html#details.
