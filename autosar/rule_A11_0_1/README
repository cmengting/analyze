POD Type have 2 prerequisites:
1. Trivially Copyable Class
2. Standard-Layout Class

Ref https://devdocs.io/cpp/language/classes#POD_class

For Trivially Copyable Class:
where each copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator,
move assigment operator is either deleted or trivial that has at least
one non-deleted copy constructor,move constructor, copy assignment operator,
or move assignment operator, and that has a trivial, non-deleted destructor

For Standard-Layout Class:
1. no virtual functions or virtual base classes
2. all non-static data members have the same access control
3. all non-static members of class type are standard-layout
4. any base classes are standard-layout
5. has no base classes of the same type as the first non-static data member.
